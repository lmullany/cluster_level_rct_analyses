    "## Cluster-level Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ENAT study, clusters (not individual participants) were allocated to the nutrition intervention (or NOT). In this type of design, analyses at the individual level that do not account for this clustered-randomization will under-estimate the variance in the effect size, leading to a false sense of confidence in estimate of the effect size. There are many ways to account for the cluster-level randomization, and this accounting can be done either in individual analyses (through for example, random effects models or generalized estimating equations) or at the cluster level, using aggregate analyses.  This notebook focuses on the latter approach, which is commonly suggested when the number of clusters is small. "
